JavaScript (Functions, Validations, Types, Loops, Objects, Local Storage, Date)

Functions and Validations:
Write a function validateEmail(email) that takes an email string as input.
The function should return true if the email is in a valid format (e.g., contains "@" and a domain), and false otherwise.
Include checks for empty strings and incorrect data types.
Example valid email: "[email address removed]"
Example invalid email: "testexample.com", "", 123

Types and Loops:
Write a function countVowels(str) that takes a string as input.
The function should use a for...of loop to iterate through the string and return the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string, regardless of case.
Example: countVowels("Hello World") should return 3.

Objects:
Create an object student with the following properties: firstName, lastName, age, and grades (an array of numbers).
Write a function calculateAverageGrade(student) that takes the student object as input and returns the average of the grades.
Example: student = {firstName:"john", lastName: "doe", age: 20, grades: [80,90,70]}

Local Storage and JSON:
Create an array of objects representing products, each with name, price, and quantity properties.
Write a function saveProductsToLocalStorage(products) that takes the array of products as input and saves it to local storage as a JSON string.
Write another function loadProductsFromLocalStorage() that retrieves the products from local storage, parses the JSON string, and returns the array of objects.

Date Object:
Write a function formatDate(date) that takes a Date object as input and returns a formatted date string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
Create a form with a date input, and when the form is submitted, use your formatDate function to display the chosen date in the correct format.
Write a function that calculates the number of days between two date objects.

Extending Loops:
Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array.   
Given an array of strings, write a function that returns a new array containing only the strings that have a length greater than 5.   

HTML and CSS
HTML Structure:
Create an HTML form with the following input fields: firstName, lastName, email, password, and dateOfBirth.
Include a submit button.
Use appropriate HTML5 input types (e.g., email, date).

CSS Styling:
Style the form created in the previous question using CSS.
Add styles for input fields, labels, and the submit button.
Use CSS to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
Create a div that changes background color on hover.
Create a simple grid layout using css.

HTML and Javascript interaction:
Create a button, that when clicked, changes the text of a paragraph element.
Create a form that when submitted, prevents the default action, and console logs the form's input values.
HTML input date
Create an input of type date.
Create a paragraph.
When the date input changes, display the selected date in the paragraph.

Git
Basic Git Commands:
Explain the purpose of the following Git commands: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git clone, git push, git pull.
Describe the steps involved in creating a new Git repository, adding files, and committing changes.
Branching and Merging:
Explain the purpose of Git branches.
Describe the steps involved in creating a new branch, switching between branches, and merging branches.
Explain what a merge conflict is, and how to resolve one.

Remote Repositories:
Explain how to connect a local Git repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
Describe the process of pushing and pulling changes between local and remote repositories.
Tips for Success

Practice Regularly: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with the concepts.
Understand the Fundamentals: Ensure you have a solid understanding of the basic syntax and concepts of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Break Down Problems: If you encounter a complex problem, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.
Use Developer Tools: Use your browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to debug your code and inspect HTML and CSS.
Review Documentation: Refer to the official documentation for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git.
